5	 Really happy with the quality! Works for paper background.. Wasn’t sure at the beginning as the stand looked very unstable and kind of “slim legged” .. but as I’ve assembled it I’m very happy and satisfied with the quality it’s solid and strong! Really worth buying ! :) 
1	 I purchased two of these via Amazon and suspect they are frauds.I have 1 3 year old ps4 controller and these 2 new ones. The old controller battery lasts 4x longer vs the new ones from amazon. And the USB charging port on the controller is snug on the original vs extremely loose falls off on the two new ones.These ones being sold via amazon are junk, but unfort cs not doing much to assist me at this times with workable solutions (I'm intl).You have all been warned! 
3	 It was okay. Poor packaging. I did make use of a couple things, mainly the floatation piece and screws. The quality of the pieces was just “okay”. In hindsight I may have just bought the pieces separately from the main brand. 
1	 These will not charge and have not worked since they arrived!  Very disappointed. 
4	 Bought this because my ancient DVD player finally gave up. Wanted to upgrade to a blue ray player but the gf has a very large DVD collection and they are still much cheaper.  Have watched at least 25 dvds so far and love the up-scaling. Noticed a larger difference in the newer dvds than the older but i expected that. Remote is well organized and the small size of the player is nice. Sleek and un assuming. 
5	 Too easy with the app. I’m an old IT guy.. you kids have no idea how good you have it. This was just ridiculous how easy it is to install. Bypassed the routing function on AT&T modem and set this up to mask the old SSID in like 10 minutes tops. 
2	 Touchscreen was not as responsive with it in, so I took it off after a day. Wish I worked better 
2	 I received this item and installed it about 20 days later, and at least one of the bearings are bad.  Noisy rotation, especially at speed, with a grinding noise.  Overall, this manufacturer is normally quite good, but this one's fan bearing quality leaves something to be desired. 
4	 I bought this about 3 months ago to primarily have a 2nd monitor for my laptop when I travel. I like that it is lightweight and actually has a wider screen than my laptop but still fits in my laptop backpack. TheRe are two downsides:  one is the screen brightness is not as bright as I’d like (and i have it as bright as it will go and the second downside is the power cord that plugs into an outlet is not very long. I either have to use an extension cord or be right next to a wall plug. Suggestion to the manufacturer is to make the power cord a little longer. Other than that it works well and is great for travel! 
3	 These chargers seem to be fairly hit and miss. I ordered one pair about three years ago and they survived two full years of wear and tear, however I bought a replacement set in January of this year and both of them have already broken (it’s now April) so it seems like you never really know what you’re going to get with these. The length is perfect, although I am extremely disappointed with this last set. I am the kind of person that is not hard on my Chargers at all, I’ve been able to make them last 3+ years before. I don’t know what it is with this last batch, but there is no reason they should’ve given out on me after only three months of use. If I hadn’t already passed my 30 day refund capability, I would be returning these as they are NOT up to par.
